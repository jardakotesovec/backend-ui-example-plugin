# Backend UI Example Plugin
Example plugin to illustrate
- How to inject your own vue component to smarty template
- How to use components from ui-library
- How to use dialog mixin
- How to do API data fetching
- How to extend existing ui-library component

Caveat: These examples assume exposing additional ui-library components & some mixins in https://github.com/pkp/pkp-lib/issues/9089 . Aiming to include these changes in minor 3.4.0 release. If you want to experiment before its included, you can easily copy&paste the load.js file changes as changes are only in this one file.
